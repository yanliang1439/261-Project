# Project Proposal: Verified Guess Number Game with AI

## Objective
- Implement a number guessing game
- Support AI player with optimal guessing strategy
- Verify correctness using Dafny

## Methods
- Game loop with input validation
- AI generates guesses using binary search
- Maintain guess history
- Verification points: 
  - Loop invariants for guess count and valid range
  - Postconditions for win/loss
  - AI correctness for optimal guessing

## Deliverables
- Dafny source code
- Verification documentation
- Presentation slides
